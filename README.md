# Database Security
In this document, I include two articles discussing the concerns and opinions regarding database security. 

## Article 1
In [Top 10 for 2024 - Happy Data Privacy Day!](https://www.natlawreview.com/article/top-10-2024-happy-data-privacy-day#:~:text=Already%20in%202024%2C%20New%20Jersey,Children's%20data%20protections%20will%20expand.), The National Law Review (TNLR) presented their top ten data privacy and cybersecurity predictions. In particular, the article predicted that AI will continue to expand in 2024 as will the regulations to protect individuals' privacy and secure data when deploying newly-developed technologies. 

The article addressed advocate of promoting database security from a perspective of exogenous regulations. The article gave several examples such as the New York City AI law and the state's still-developing AI bill of rights. The article stated that it is more of the governing power's responsibility to guard individuals' data privacy. 

## Article 2
In [Governing Novelty](https://www.dbta.com/BigDataQuarterly/Articles/Governing-Novelty-162181.aspx), the Database Trends and Applications (DBTA) addressed a similar concern. The article also called for promoting regulations of "these new AI gifts, or gremlins" to better protect database security, but stated that some believed that that governments' rush to address the regulation migh have been deflecting attention away from pre-existing AI risks. 

However, this article called for an emphasis on indogenous and internal risk management. The article stated that given the rapid development if AI and other emerging technologies, companies that lead this trend of innovation should develop more resilient and adaptive governance practices.
